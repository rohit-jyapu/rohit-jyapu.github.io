				<h4>About Me</h4>
				<p>Hi, my name is <strong>Rohit Maharjan</strong> and I am currently doing intern at <strong>Halftone Design</strong> Company as a front end developer. I have joined Halfton Design for 3 months now and I have thoroughly enjoyed myself here. Before I joined Halftone Design I was studied at the <strong>Academia International College</strong> for a bachelor degree. I was born and raised in <strong>Kathamandu city</strong> and grew up here.</p>

				<p>I am an <span>interesting</span>, <span>fun loving guy</span> with a good <span>sense of humor</span>. One thing about me that is important to know though is that at first I come of as a very shy individualistic guy but once I get to know people and are comfortable with my environment I am great. It is hard for me to make friends but once I make them, it’s great and I am all different. I <span>joke</span>, <span>laugh</span> and <span>humor</span> people and I also get as much as I give. I am a very <span>kind</span>, <span>compassionate</span>, <span>sensitive guy</span> as my close friends will tell you. <span>I have a tough shell but on the inside I am soft</span>. I am also a very principled person and stand strong on what is right and wrong. I am also a very <span>straight</span> and <span>honest</span> person. I understand and know that we all put on a show sometimes and do not show who we really are or what we feel but some people do this constantly and those kinds of people I cannot stand.</p>
